"""
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

Build trie out of input words
For each word, test if it is the start of a valid word square
- find words that match its second letter

Recursively:
- Add word to current square
    - Find valid words for the next position
    - add them recursively
